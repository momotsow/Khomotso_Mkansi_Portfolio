      <br><p class="story"> This was my first coding project. We were given a brief of creating a tribute page on a person we look up to, and I chose Jack Ma for his well known resilience
      I used HTML and CSS to solve this brief, well since it was my first time coding I had to learn both languages in less than 5 days.
      <br><br>It was quite interesting and challenging to learn it in the small period of time, but hey if you ask me I cracked it.

    <center><h4> Human Centered Design </h4></center>
    <br><br><p class="story"> We were given a brief of improving the eating culture of an Umuzi recruit. 
      We focussed on the Umuzi recruit who goes out and buy food using Human Centered Design.
      We had a few challenges since everyone have different preferences, there is no strict lunch hour and people buy at different places.
      We had to do an MVP which is a Minimum Viable Product and our MVP was to organize a food club for people to go buy lunch in groups and
      we organized a "menu" like where we have menus of different restaurants and also got discounts for Umuzi people when they buy in groups; Which then
      encouraged people to buy in groups and for them to socialize more as thus we have more collaborations from different departments now.
    <br>I learnt not to assume that everyone likes the same things and also learnt that people do not know 
      a lot of information about where they buy their food-they did not know that the places they buy offer delivery.
                                  
    <br><br>As I like to say we have made UMUZI better.

    <br><br><p class="storys"> This is my recent work. We were given a brief of coding our website portfolio as web developers.  
      I used HTML, CSS, bootstrap and JavaScript to solve the brief. The challenging part was to design the look and feel of my website as it is a represanation of me, it speaks on my behalf.
      
    <br><br>I finally came a conclusion of what I have now, a fusion of colors and a minimalistic feel.
